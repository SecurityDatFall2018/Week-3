# Week-3

# Day-1 (Wednesday)  A2 + A5

## What to Read

At first, it might seem like there are an awful lot to read, but totally it sums up to 10-15 pages only, if you distribute the readings among your group as suggested below, so just go ahead a start reading ;-)

#### A2
- Read the OWASP description for [A2](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication)
- Read about [credential stuffing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Credential_stuffing)
- Read/skim some of the references given in [A2](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication). You should distribute the “readings” among your group, since one of the exercises for day-1, will be to explain what you read, to rest of your group.
- Make sure that you all skim the [Cheat Sheet related to session management](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet), since this is where we will focus our practical attacks day-2

#### Watch
If you prefer to watch/listen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1iGRBG3PJ8) is short but still pretty informative

#### A5
Read the OWASP description for [A5](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control)
Read/skim some of the references given in [A5](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control). You should distribute the “readings” among your group, since one of the exercises for day-1, will be to explain what you read, to rest of your group.
